["9 Froxmere Close, Solihull, West Midlands B91 3XG Dear Mr Michael O’Raw Signed By Dr. Adeel Riaz Dr. Adeel Riaz Never before has the need to detoxify our body system become more important than today. With the advancement of technology there are now more things that negatively affect our health and our environment. The air we breathe, the water we drink, even the food we eat is polluted in one way or the other. This is because the air we breathe has carbon byproducts and the water we drink has heavy metals and the food we eat is not as natural as it should be. Most of it is chemically enhanced or genetically modified one way or the other. All these things make the statement that “We live in a very toxic age” very true! In order to live longer and healthier there is a growing need to detoxify our bodies. If you don’t detox regularly, these poisonous substances from the air you breath, the water you drink and the food you eat will lead to ill-health such as insomnia, gastric problems, poor skin, premature aging due to accumulation of toxins over the years and ultimately untimely death. You can decide to naturally detox or take herbs and vitamins to detox. A lot of people choose to detox naturally because they know the body has its own ability to clean itself up. Our bodies have natural defenses and resources that work to constantly to clean up our systems, even when we sleep. Unfortunately, most people’s bodies are unable to detox mainly because of poor health. If the body is performing at optimal level, it should be able to detox itself. As I’ve mentioned before, because of the polluted air, water and food we eat, it becomes impossible for anyone’s body to perform at optimal level. There is always some form of pollution affecting the body one way or the other. That is why it is necessary to use some detox herbs and vitamins to assist the body in detoxifying itself. These detox herbs and vitamins can help to restore the body to its optimal level, thereby giving it the strength to detox it self. These detox herbs and vitamins and some healthy habits can really go a long way in helping the body to take care of it self, thereby allowing us to live longer. So, if you want to live longer and healthier, there is the need to constantly detoxify your system either naturally or with the help of detox herbs and vitamins. Never before has the need to detoxify our body system become more important than today.
